# Generative-deep-learning
Machine Learning Project  - Summer Semester 2020, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano.

The aim of the project was to code a LSTM-layered neural network to feed with text in order to generate some strings with the very same style of writing. 
In this peculiar situation, Iâ€™ve taken into consideration the data of Potus from the Twitter Social Network.
