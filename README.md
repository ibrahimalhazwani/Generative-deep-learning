# Generative-deep-learning
Machine Learning Project  - Summer Semester 2020

The aim of the project was to code a LSTM-layered neural network to feed with text in order to generate some strings with the very same style of writing. 
In this peculiar situation, weâ€™ve taken into consideration the data from the Twitter Social Network.
